## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

## Textbooks

Cho, Z-H., J. Jones, and M. Singh. _Foundations of Medical Imaging._

## Goals

This course aims to provide an introduction to the physics and engineering of tomographic imaging devices. It is offered at an introductory level and assumes no prior contact with the material; the only prerequisites are differential equations and an introduction to electricity and magnetism. The course is a combination of lectures and demonstrations.

## Prerequisites

8.02 (Introductory Mechanics & Electromagnetism), 18.03 (Differential Equations)

## Computer Usage

Frequent use for demonstrations, and homework problems. I request that you use either MatLab or Mathematica to develop simple tools of image processing.

## Collaboration on Homework Assignments

All quizzes, midterms, and the final must be each individuals own effort. Collaborating on the homework assignments is encouraged provided that each student hands in their own version at the end. The photocopy or the same material from two (or more) students will not be accepted. Please do collaborate, but afterwards pull your own thoughts together and write out the homework assignment answers yourself.

## Attendance

Attendance is expected and required. The lectures will not be taken from the text and part of the class time will be given over to demonstrations.

## Grading

The course will be offered at both an undergraduate and graduate level. However, the requirements are different.

## Undergraduates

Homework: 9 assignments, the best 8 of which will each count 5 % towards the final grade.   
Midterms: 3 exams, each of which will count 20 % towards the final grade.   
Note: Undergraduate students do not have a final or a design project for this class.

## Graduates

Homework: 9 assignments, the best 8 of which will each count 3 % towards the final grade.   
Midterms: 3 exams, each of which will count 8 % towards the final grade.   
Final: 26%   
Design Paper (a description will be given out later in the course): 26 %
